### - These are several programming assignments done during Advanced Database Organization course.

### - Starting from a storage manager we implemented our own tiny database-like system from scratch.

### - We explored how to implement the concepts and data structures discussed in the lectures and readings.

### - These assignments required the use of skills we learned in this course as well as other skills we had developed throughout our program.

### - Each assignment was builded upon the code developed during the previous assignment.

### - All assignments are implemented using C language.




**[Assignment 1 - Storage Manager:](https://github.com/akash22gupta/CS-525-Advanced-Database-Organization/tree/master/assign1)** Implemented a storage manager that allows read/writing of blocks to/from a file on disk.

**[Assignment 2 - Buffer Manager:](https://github.com/akash22gupta/CS-525-Advanced-Database-Organization/tree/master/assign2)** Implemented a buffer manager that manages a buffer of blocks in memory including reading/flushing to disk and block replacement (flushing blocks to disk to make space for reading new blocks from disk).

**[Assignment 3 - Record Manager:](https://github.com/akash22gupta/CS-525-Advanced-Database-Organization/tree/master/assign3)** Implemented a simple record manager that allows navigation through records, and inserting and deleting records.

**[Assignment 4 - B+-Tree Index:](https://github.com/akash22gupta/CS-525-Advanced-Database-Organization/tree/master/assign4)** Implemented a disk-based B+-tree index structure.
